BenchLang
===========

BenchLang is a project to document and test various algorithms in many languages to compare and contrast run-times, memory times, and how each language copes when tasked with different challenges. 

Many say there is no perfect language and that one should use the tools that are more appropriate for the task. Many tools can be used for a variety of tasks. It is helpful from an academic point of view to have some experience as to where each language may shine or struggle.

The long term goal of this project is to reproduce the most common tasks I encounter in each language to understand and compare which language performs best from a cpu runtime, memory usage, and storage point of view. Finally, observations will be made as to the difficulty of implementing solutions in each language.
